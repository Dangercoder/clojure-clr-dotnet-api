  "Helper functions for the built-in clauses in honey.sql.

  All helper functions are inherently variadic. Typical
  usage is threaded, like this:

```
  (-> (select :a :b :c)
      (from :table)
      (where [:= :id 42])
      (sql/format))
```

  Therefore all helpers can take an existing DSL expression
  as their first argument or, if the first argument is not
  a hash map, an empty DSL is assumed -- an empty hash map.
  The above is therefore equivalent to:

```
  (-> {}
      (select :a :b :c)
      (from :table)
      (where [:= :id 42])
      (sql/format))
```

  Some of the helper functions here have `:arglists` metadata
  in an attempt to provide better hints for auto-complete in
  editors but those `:arglists` _always omit the DSL argument_
  to avoid duplicating the various argument lists. When you
  see an auto-complete suggestion like:

    bulk-collect-into [varname] [varname n]

  bear in mind that a DSL hash map can always be threaded in
  so the following (pseudo) arities are also available:

    bulk-collect-into [dsl varname] [dsl varname n]

  The actual arguments are:

    bulk-collect-info [& args]

  (as they are for all helper functions)."

  this accepts a single clause, constructed from on-conflict,

  This helper unpacks that clause and turns it into what HoneySQL
  2.x expects, with any where clause being an argument to the
  do-update-set helper, along with the `:fields`.

  nilenso/honeysql-postgres:

  (-> ...
      (upsert (-> (on-conflict :col)
